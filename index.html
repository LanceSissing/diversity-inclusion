              <p>We live in a time of great change as outdated perspectives are
                increasingly questioned and broader more enlightened points of
                view take their place. As the world awakens to the intrinsic
                value of every human recognition of the importanc of creating
                cultures of <strong>Diversity & Inclusion</strong> continues to
                grow.</p>
              <p>From entire countries to individual organisations, focusing on
                <strong>Diversity & Inclusion</strong> fosters openness,
                creativity and productive, fulfilled experiences. Diversity
                encompasses differences in political beliefs, race, culture,
                sexual orientation, religion, class or gender identity.
                Inclusion means ensuring everyone is fully engaged and involved,
                valued, respected, treated fairly, and integrated into the local
                culture. It involves empowering individual by recognising their
                unique talents as part of fostering an inclusive environment.</p>
              <p>Both aspects of Diversity and Inclusion are equally iportant and
                they operate hand in hand with one another - diversity without
                inclusion can result in a toxic culture whilst inclusion without
                diversity can cause stagnation and limit creativity. A recent
                Forbes survey found that 88% of employers consider D&I
                initiatives essential to their success, with 80% having a
                positive view of their impact. These efforts are not just nice
                to have â€” they are essential for attracting top talent and
                creating a workplace where everyone feels valued.</p>

                Organisations require a framework to guide their diversity and

              <ul>
                <li>Establish clear D&I goals and objectives</li>

              </ul>
              <p>Organizational change begins at the top. Upper management needs

                uncertainty. Ask critical questions about the company workforce.
                Oftentimes, these questions bring about tough, but necessary,
                conversations to drive true change. HR department and individual
                managers are responsible for enacting change and sustainin a
                D&I-centric culture. These groups should receive training and
