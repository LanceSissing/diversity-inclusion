                        <p>We live in a time of great change as outdated perspectives are increasingly 
                           questioned and broader more enlightened points of view take their place. As 
                           the world awakens to the intrinsic value of every human being the creation 
                           recognition of the importanc of creating cultures of <strong>Diversity & 
                            Inclusion</strong> continues to grow.</p>
                        <p>From entire countries to individual organisations, focusing on <strong>Diversity & 
                            Inclusion</strong> fosters openness, creativity and productive, fulfilled experiences. 
                            Diversity encompasses differences in political beliefs, 
                            race, culture, sexual orientation, religion, class or gender identity. Inclusion 
                            means ensuring everyone is fully engaged and involved, valued, respected, treated
                            fairly, and integrated into the local culture. It involves empowering individual 
                            by recognising their unique talents as part of fostering an inclusive environment.</p>
                        <p> Both aspects of Diversity and Inclusion are equally iportant and they operate hand 
                            in hand with one another - diversity without inclusion can result in a toxic culture
                            whilst inclusion without diversity can cause stagnation and limit creativity. A 
                            recent Forbes survey found that 88% of employers consider D&I initiatives essential 
                            to their success, with 80% having a positive view of their impact. These efforts are 
                            not just nice to have â€” they are essential for attracting top talent and creating a 
                            workplace where everyone feels valued.</p>

                            <strong>What is Diversity & Inclusion?</strong>
                            <br>Diversity and inclusion is ensuring different groups or individuals of different 
                            backgrounds are culturally and socially accepted and integrated into an environment or culture.
