### COLORS
Color selection was accompished using online resources such as pallette generators and AI. 
Compliance with related standards such as contrast and readability was ensured using [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and the [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) color contrast tools were used to corroborate these results.

### Palette
- Deep Sky Blue `#30C5FF` `--blue`
- Pink Lavender `#E4B7E5` `--pink`
- Russian Violet `#381A46` `--purple`
- Spring Green `#21F383` `--green`
- Vanilla `#EEEEA2` `--yellow`

### FONTS
Font selection was based on the application of the site and its formal purpose as well as consideratin of the users and the circumstances under which they would visit the portal. 
Two sans-serif fonts were selected for the project, and implemented via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) using a direct import code within the style.css file.
[Fredoka](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka) serves as playful font to be used within logos, headings other page elements of significance.
The source of selected fonts was Google fonts (https://fonts.google.com) and the required coding to allow its use was implemented in the relevant files.

## IMAGES
Although a relatively formal site, the use of images illustrating themes of the site was considered appropriate. 
The images used were created for this project using the AI generator at http://freepik.com - a paid for subscription based service.

## FEATURES

### GENERAL

The specific criteria set out in the LMS for this project were satisfied

#### NAVIGATION 
A Bootstrap 5.3 navigation bar was selected to create consistency with common user expectation and to allow for expansion of the portal beyond a single page in the future. 

#### HERO SECTION
A Bottstrap 5.3 component 'Jumbotron' was implemented to provide the initial view of the portal with impact. This approach makes the purpose and content of the portal immediately clear to the visitor and includes a call-to-action button allowing the user to move immediately to the are of the page that is most applicable to them.  

#### IMPLEMENTATION
INSERT SOMETHING HERE

#### FOOTER
A footer that is consistent with user expectations was implemented to provide information and links in a format and location commonly expected. Bootstrap was used to create consistency across the site. 

#### RESPONSIVE DESIGN
Utilising the Bootstrap Framework provided a method to develop a page that remains is responsive across the usual range of devices form mobile plratforms to high resolution computer screens.
The utility at 'Am I Responsive' - https://ui.dev/amiresponsive was used to test responsiveness along with repeated use of the developer tools provided by web browsers.
